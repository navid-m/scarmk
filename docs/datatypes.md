# Data Types

## i32

`i32` is a 32-bit signed integer type. It can represent whole numbers in the range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. This type is commonly used for numeric values where memory efficiency and performance are important, and negative values may be required.

## i16

`i16` is a 16-bit signed integer type. It can represent whole numbers in the range from -32,768 to 32,767. This type is useful when you need to save memory and the range of values fits within these limits.

## u32

`u32` is a 32-bit unsigned integer type. It can represent whole numbers from 0 to 4,294,967,295. Use this type when you need a large range of positive numbers and do not require negative values.

## u16

`u16` is a 16-bit unsigned integer type. It can represent whole numbers from 0 to 65,535. This type is suitable for small positive numbers and is often used for indexing or representing data where negative values are not needed.

## f32

`f32` is a 32-bit floating-point type. It can represent fractional numbers (numbers with decimals) with approximately 7 decimal digits of precision. Use `f32` when you need to store real numbers and memory usage is a concern.

## f64

`f64` is a 64-bit floating-point type. It can represent fractional numbers with approximately 15 decimal digits of precision. `f64` is the default floating-point type in many languages and is preferred when higher precision is required.
