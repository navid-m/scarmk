### Overview

The parallel block can be used alone in order to parallelize a set of executable statements.

```
parallel:
    print "Task 1 running"
    print "Task 2 running"
    for i = 0 to 5:
        print "Loop iteration: %d" | i

print "After parallel block"
```

This is highly useful in cases where you want to execute multiple independent tasks simultaneously, such as performing computations, handling I/O operations, or processing data in parallel to improve performance and reduce overall execution time.

In leveraging the parallel block, you can maximize resource utilization and make your programs more efficient, especially on multi-core systems.

### Syntax

The `parallel` block starts with the `parallel:` keyword, followed by an indented list of statements. Each statement within the block is executed concurrently.

### Example Use Cases

-  Running multiple data processing tasks at the same time.
-  Performing network requests in parallel.
-  Handling multiple file operations simultaneously.

### Considerations

When using parallel blocks, ensure that shared resources are managed properly to avoid race conditions. Synchronization mechanisms may be necessary if tasks interact with shared data.

### Related Constructs

Other concurrency constructs, such as threads or asynchronous functions, can also be used for parallel execution, depending on the requirements of your program.
